# Online-Food-Ordering-System
Project Overview

The Online Food Ordering System is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Python application that allows users to order food items from a predefined menu. The system takes user input for item selection and quantity, calculates the total bill, applies discounts based on order value, and displays a detailed final bill.
This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and user input handling.
